<h2><a href="#n3">3—</a></h2>
<h4>‘In a Tokyo suburb, a young man named Toru Okada searches for his wife’s missing cat—and then for his wife as well—in a netherworld beneath the city’s placid surface. As these searches intersect, he encounters a bizarre group of allies and antagonists.’
Okada reaches this world through descending into the unusually deep dry well in an abandoned neighbour’s garden. There he once stays for days on end experiencing where his psychosis would take him to find what he has lost.</h4>

<h4>Individual experiences are not as individual as we thing they are. Now if that’s not a blow to the ego I don’t know what is.</h4>

<h2><a href="#n5"><li>Shut up, I'm Having a Moment</li></a></h2>
<h4>It’s a warm August (or July) night and we are on the beach. We are five women, girls really, one of us is turning 15 and we all sitting on sunbeds on the sand, listening to music and talking. No one is around us, we’ve kept our distance from the neighbouring clubs and restaurants. As I’m listening to the conversation, suddenly I completely lose any interest in these people’s conversation. Their existence looses its reality and I hear a different music. Later they said I had a far-away look on my face. I strip naked and slowly walk into the water, as if feeling the air and water for the first time. They are calling for me but I don’t want to answer, if I do I’ll snap out and lose this opportunity to experience. Experience what exactly I don’t know, I just know it was important and that 7 years later this moment is still clear as day in my memory. Later my friends were very upset with me for doing what I did. When I told the about my moment the looked at me like I was crazy. I say that’s their problem.</h4>
