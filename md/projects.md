<p>The topic of this essay is the phenomenon of re-experiencing familiarity and experiencing the familiar as ‘strangely new’, (deja vu and jamais vu respectively), how it can be induced, and to what level can it be experienced collectively, resulting in a kind of fictional collective encounter, a speculative folie a deux. The methodology in use is exploration and analysis of cases of artistic expression that I intertwine with intuitive personal encounters. My aim is to use that as a mental platform for discovering missing links or lost memories in individual experiences. I here speak in three voices—one of reflection, one of personal recollection and one of delusion. The reader is taken on a journey to a realm of derealisation and confusion and introduced to its inhabitants, the characters of curiosity and misfortune. Focusing on and challenging these deviant encounters has the potential to show people to a place where one might reinvent their relations, or even find fluidity in their persona. This research has no linear objective, will propose no definite answers, as its aim in to dive in a sensation that is usually dismissed as strange, often unpleasantly so.</p>
<h2 id='s1'><li>The Sticks, The Chicken and The Apple</li></h2>
<h5>I had a strange dream that was interrupted by a stranger lapse—I was sitting in a low, dimly lit room, silhouettes of people squatting in front of me.</h5>
<h5>Me and a group of backpackers are going down a hill after a long hike. We’ve been in the Pirin mountains for the past week and are now descending to the next hut to spend the night. Spirits are high and I am hungry, moving down in a fast pace. With me is a woman I will here call M and we can almost smell the awaiting dinner. On the last kilometre, M falls and completely crushes her ankle. It swings loosely like the twisted neck of a chicken. I’m scared for her. M is in her 40s and just a few days ago she mentioned to me she had never broken a bone. The men rush to us and make a quick job of binding her freely dangling foot. As the sticks and bones are fixed together, the sound they make is like eating a ripe apple. They carry her to the hut and we sit in the dark entrance hall, waiting. When the medics arrave they start to replace the wood-made cradle with a more proficient one. I sit there on the ground next to her and hold her hand. She is afraid she would never walk again. In an instant I know exactly what is going to happen in the next few seconds. I don’t guess from the expression on her face the terrible pain she is gonna feel as they move her splint to the side, because she doesn’t know it yet. For me its like a movie I’ve rewatched a thousand times. I tell the medics to stop. They murmur something and for a moment that rips me out of my massive deja vu, as this interaction is not prescripted. Regardless, they move the splint and I snap back in in full recognition as she screams in agony and consequently they stop. </h5>
<h5>I’ve never had such a clear memory of the future again. No other deja vu has reached past familiarity of the present. I have a vague memory of eating chicken soup later that night.</h5>
<h5>M made a full recovery more than a year later and she is still a passionate hiker, traversing rocky terrains with eight titanium nails in her body.</h5>

<h2 id="ch1"><a href="#chapter1">1. The Missing Stair</a></h2>
<p>As humans we have a biological obsession with pattern making and relying on the recognition of them. Our belief in familiarity is so strong that when the pattern is just slightly off it makes us feel like we are going down the stairs and have missed a step. Such domestic examples serve to prove that an unexpected change of what we anticipate registers as mentally disturbing. We create controlled environments and shy away from what shakes us. We are safe in our norms, but the unusual can give us a new pair of eyes. Imagination proposes the future, so lets nurture it. This text is about deja vu—pattern, a ghost of a memory, and her opposite—jamais vu, an eerie sense of experiencing something rationally familiar as if for the first time. Depending on our level of comfort with the obscure, these sensations prompt wonder and/or anxiety.</p>
<p>Much less people report on experiencing jamais vu compared to deja vu, due to its elusive nature and abstract definition. Fewer yet are the phenomena’s mentions as a collective encounter, as a folie à deux. I will raise more questions than I can answer here but I like to imagine this work as the official start of a deeper search on memory and identity. The cases I will comment on are based on my subjective connection to them and will serve as a ground level to build my essay. Both the phenomena and the nature of the cases is experiential so I’m driven to the domain of performance and installation art and cinema. As in E. O’Sullivan’s ‘Returning to Jamais Vu: Uncanny encounters in the live art archive and in the flesh’ a key moment in this research will be the act of ‘re’-living’. A simpler method to grasp the matter of deja vu and jamais vu, is to attempt to re-experience a situation. Reliving can be a powerful tool to over-familiarise ourselves with an encounter charging from our depth of perception and help us gain understanding not solely of the isolated event of focus, but also of its patterns of repetition. O’Sullivan revisits a performance titled, unironically, ‘Jamais Vu’ by the visual artist Anna Seagrave, through seeing it as a spectator several times in its running course of two years, performative writing, photographs, footages and eventually reenacting it a few times herself. Adrian Heathfield describes performative writing as ‘not simply upon a subject or about it but, rather, is “of” it in the sense that it issues from it, is subject to its force and conditions’. It communicates your experience, and not what you think of it. Imagine you’re recalling a dream you’ve had earlier that night. The more you focus on having a clearer picture, the less analytical you become. It helps make your story tangible. If you reenact an encounter enough times your memories of it start slipping through each other as tributaries forming a river.</p> 
    <h2 id='s2'><a href="#n1"><li>Mistiming</li></a></h2>
    <h5>Another example, which proves to be a rather unfortunate one, is mistiming. A late evening in October I was leaving with a plane to attend an exhibition. I had a meticulous plan for the next 3 days and even thought I had included enough space for any random chaos that could bestow upon me. I missed that flight by an hour because I had full belief in remembering the departure time right. It was a flight I’d take regularly and I checked everything so many times, yet I was way off. I missed a stair and entered a rather unpleasant mental state of barely containable panic, unable to trust anything I see. Suddenly the airport I had visited dozens of times and the timetables, which I would read every day, had become confusing and unfamiliar. </h5>

<h2 id="ch2"><a href="#chapter2">2. To Wander on</a></h2>
<p>In the novel by Haruki Murakami The Wind-up Bird Chronicle the protagonist has an experience of similar nature. Toru Okada descends a deep dry well, looking for his wife’s missing cat and later for his wife as well. He is swallowed by a bizarre netherworld below Tokyo and crosses roads with peculiar people, some of aid and others of trouble. To access the underland, few of us have a well, but worry not, there are other ways. In the book ‘Poetics of Space’ Gaston Bachelard speaks of the cellar: ‘it is first and foremost the dark entity of the house, the one that partakes in subterranean forces. When we dream there, we are in harmony with the irrationality of the depths.’ I may be claustrophobic, but this plunge below is so enticing, as deja vu and jamais vu thrive here, in a realm of confusion and derealisation. Whenever I come back to my own underground a new curious installation has sprung out from the floor, ceiling or walls.</p>
<p>As I walk through the brightly lit spaces the companions Im here with bear less and less significance to the visit. Today they talk too much and I’m not interested in listening. I know we are visiting an embassy or something like that but haven’t bothered to read into it at all. The building is not so large, but its weight squishes the ground underneath. I gravitate towards it. Having just moved to this sad country during a dire lockdown that is the first space I feel real silence in. As the thick concrete walls enclose me in an threatening fashion, Im deeply pacified. We go in and I walk into a small room with no windows and a yellowish wallpaper and ceiling. There is a red mattress in the corner and a mirror opposite the mattress. Nothing else but dense, moist air. I take a look at myself in the mirror, but the person I see could very well be someone else. My throat tightens and I exit the room. In some of the other spaces there are bodies lying on the ground, half covered by fabrics or plastic. I don’t know this place but now I want to see what is behind every door, see if I can disappear into it without a word. I follow the low gargle of pipes, descending a staircase, wilfully sinking into a black hole. The basement is a frozen 60s scene, abandoned and empty. Someone has cleared out the rooms and now just their skeletons remain. The pipes are their bones, the thin mouldy walls, their cartilage. I enter a lower section, where lies a large cage-room with sinks and a container. Its door is left ajar and there is no light coming from inside. I walk in and shut the door behind me.</p>

<p>It would be years before I walk through this basement again. The text above is an interpretational memory of my first encounter with Gregor Schneider’s Tote Räume exhibition in West Den Haag in late 2020. The focus of this chapter is the ways in which deja vu and jamais vu are brought to their beholders through different media. Looking at the mirror was a subconscious act of seeking comfort in the recognition of my own face as the environment that engulfed me was so off putting. The container in the basement was a part of the artist’s experiments with sensory deprivation. Years later, in 2023, I had several occasions to go back to this small underworld and was shown into a room I had missed the first time—a replica of a small, brightly lit, fully white room with a door that was a bit too heavy for my comfort. That was the ‘Interrogation Room’, a space used in a U.S. detention facility in Cuba for 'clean torture’, now together with much of the basement design, a leftover of Tote Räume. There, I try to follow the tread of a forgotten memory, but my mind is as desolate as these rooms, submerged in sticky grey fog. I’ve discovered the spring of the experiential ambivalence of this obscurity—one can draw a great deal of comfort from the bleakness and numbness. The skeletons of these ‘dead rooms’ gave me a reliant structure to project my own lost narrative upon. They mould as we bury our bodies and thoughts there. I have not meditated in a tomb but I imagine this is what beginning to feels like—I am mining this basement for the missing links in my own memories. I am the man at the bottom of the well, I’m a protagonist in a plotless movie. Its a deja vu, a dance of movements that I do not remember learning but know by heart. Can I gain the ability to reconstruct myself? I want to see where did the missing step go.</p>
<p>Schneider is by far not the only visual artist who has perfected sharing a deja vu or jamais vu with his audience, although the topic of the latter is explored on a considerably smaller scale in the art world. Another example is Bruce Nauman’s Going Around the Corner installation (1920) which consists of four televisions and four cameras placed on identical spots around a large white cube. As the visitor walk around the four corners they see the image of themselves on the screen recorded live from the corresponding camera behind them. This makes the encounter a constant re-experience, a very effective one in its sterility.</p>
<p>Switching to another media, Director Ben Joseph Andrews and producer Emma Roberts’ Turbulence: Jamais vu is a creation of unusual genre, a documentary animation. The 10-minute short film is in Mixed Reality and is based on the director’s chronic vestibular condition that causes destabilising episodes of dizziness or imbalance. Sadly, I am unable to experience this film first hand, as it is currently inaccessible. The best I can do is associate it with other MR and VR works I’ve participated in and speak based on reviews and interviews. The film records your real life surroundings through a depth camera attached to the headset. You’re invited to a monochrome world with a flipped vision where the environment is characterised by flickering white outlines. This dizziness of a powerful jamais vu is familiar to me, although not nearly to this extreme extent. Just as with performative writing, the use of VR, to make a language that immerses the user in situations that are very difficult to articulate, is as close secondary source to an individual encounter as any.</p>

<p>Having already established some spaces of deja vu and jamais vu, now it is time to introduce their inhabitants. Permanently living in their realm is a bad fortune, an invisible illness. There is probably a thick book of characters stuck in their right of passage, a contemporary purgatory. One that picked my interest is Le Passe-Muraille—the man from a Parisian fairy tale that could to walk through solid matter, but as he abused his powers for thievery and beguilement and got stuck in a wall. A sculpture to embed his misery in time has sprung out from a wall in the deep catacombs of Paris by unknown artist/s. Robert Macfarlane describes that it ‘shows the man at this moment of simultaneous liberation and entrapment—his face, torso and one leg pulled clear from the masonry, his back and hands still immured. He is caught between realms, unsure whether to proceed into air or retreat into stone.’</p>
<p>Le Passe-Muraille’s neighbour is the protagonist from Kafka on the Shore, whose journey takes him to a small cabin in the woods where he is warned not to roam about. Kafka enters the forest and abandons his map and compass on a wild path. He encounters ghosts, memories, inexplicable natural phenomena. Two men from another time show him to an empty village. There he is catered by the young version of a woman he loves, now a girl he has never met. Kafka is offered to stay there with her forever but eventually returns to the world of the living knowing he would never see her again. The whole encounter can be perceived as a modern twist on Orpheus and Eurydice’s story of how she remained in the underworld. Next to Kafka and Le Passe-Muraille, I would put myself, should I spend too much time in the Tote Räume basement and recklessly sink deep enough into derealisation, just because I love a good story. Focused on breathing, I thug my nails in my wrist, pulling myself out. Not all of these characters escape or move on from their liminal demise. Some of them are there as a form of punishment of their own exploits, others came in accidentally or were forced into it. Then there are those of us dive in willingly, tricked by our own curiosity. The realm of deja vu and jamais vu can quickly become a sinkhole, an ever-growing cave, and the further on you go, the harder it is to remember your own name.</p>

<h2 id="ch3"><a href="#chapter3">3. Mirror, Mirror in the Wall</a></h2>
<p>The characters of curiosity and misfortune see with the same eyes, they are acquainted with each other. What happens when multiple people associate with the same fictional narrative? A folie a deux (translated: madness for two) is a psychotic disorder, however I will not be diving into the psychiatric aspects of the phenomenon as I am interested in its symbolic meaning. In an article in Aperture magazine Gesine Borcherdt discusses Gregor Schneider’s Die Familie Schneider. This exhibition took place in 2004 in two neighbouring houses at 14 na 16 Walden Street in London. Per the artist’s instruction the interiors were crafted to be indistinguishably alike and a restriction of a maximum of two people visiting simultaneously was in place. However, inside you are not alone—a man and a woman are there engaged in mundane activities, one washing the dishes and the other one jerking off in the shower. These actors have twins, and their sibling is enacting the same routine in the second house. As a guest suffers a suffocating derealisation, their state could reach anywhere from uneasiness to psychosis. ‘Observing yourself observing spaces’ is how Schneider describes it. Someone put a gigantic mirror in the wall and you walked though it without any recollection, sleepwalking. Any individual experience is lost in this perfect repetition. If that is not a blow to the ego I don’t know what is.</p>
<p>Folie a deux is mostly referenced to in medical cases of a dominant person sharing their delusions with a labile one. I imagine a scenario where sharing your realm with others is non harming. That’s artist’s domain. Can a deja vu be re-experienced simultaneously by two? Any memory can be a delusion, depending on how it relates to the objective truth. Imagine visiting Die Familie Schneider with a partner: as this is an artistically engineered environment, chances are you have a relatively close (and fresh, as the the two houses are meant to visited one right after the other) experience of the first house on number 14 and would together reenter this memory on number 16.</p>

<h2 id='s3'><li>A trip to never</li></h2>
<h5>I have a beautiful memory of visiting Bran Castle in Transylvania as a child. I’m inside, walking up and down the hallways, crouching as the ceilings get lower. That must be because people were way shorter during its construction. Descending one of the towers I admire the lush forest through the barred windows. The forged steel curves in peculiar forms, flourishing into a pattern of crowns. In this late and hot summer the air coming from the lower chambers is refreshingly cold. I spend a long time wandering around on my own, my fingers tracing the exposed stone work.</h5>
<h5>I asked my parents if we could do a trip to the castle again, only to be met with the answer we’ve never been to Romania. One day, I will visit again.</h5>

<p>An example with a theological concept is Werner Herzog’s Fata Morgana (1970). The film invites us into its reoccurring landscapes with a mythical narration. It requires the viewer to be willing to enter an almost trance-like state, otherwise they will be lost a boredom of slow repetition. Fata Morgana has a flow instead of a plot. The director’s initial plan was to use the Sahara desert setting as a place where earthy inhabitants are awaiting an unavoidable apocalypse, ‘a collision with the sun in exactly sixteen years’ in his words. The final product would have been produced by both human and alien filmmakers. As Herzog later abandoned this story line, its traces are still visible in the desolate landscapes. The film might have lost its plot but the juxtaposing concept only gained clarity. Watching it is cruising through my own fever dream, and this time I find my accomplices there. I spy with my little eye, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, in their arrival, engulfed in light and surrounded by stars, their shine more exuberant than ever. Should they be deprived of the recognition of their feat and still live to tell about it, they would be considered delusional, individuals of their own Fata Morgana, no different than the desert inhabitants in the context of the Mayan creation myth narration here.</p>
<p>The film gives the observer a pair of eyes that incline an innate fictional belief. In me it sparks a jamais vu, a remainder of a time spent between Cairo and the Red Sea. In their arid brutality and agoraphobic qualities these bleak and barren landscapes are here narrated as a land of harmony between human, nature and spirit. I share the depths of their delirium.</p>

<h2 id="ch4"><a href="#chapter4">4. On a single day I choke on water, sand and fumes</a></h2>
<p>On a single day I choke on water, sand and fumes. My memory carries me to a seat on a small bus where I am staring out the window in with dry eyes wide open. Im starved by the infinite heat. Also I didn’t bring enough food for the road. I’ve been sick for days, now I can’t even feed. In a world where the desert gave birth to earth one doesn’t need to feed. If I could eat the sun I would be full forever. Many tiny pieces of dust obscure my vision and the heavy smell of petrol coming from the tank is ever-present. Time has a different structure here, it is beyond human domestication. The Sahara doesn’t care about a clock. There are more characters in this story and as we breathe the same air, we see with the same eyes. They are sitting on the rows behind me in silence. Im sure of this as they, as I do, cough from time to time and keep a strange gaze through the glass, as the scenery remains unchanged. We share a body of stained lungs and breathe through a mouth covered with a dirty cloth. This vessel is slowly boiled from the inside, slime and blood to soon evaporate, their colours exhumed, just as the ocean did from this dirt road a millennia ago. My thin skin pulsates softly, in light pain of all the exposure. Travelling for hours, yet we haven’t moved an inch. I stretch my legs under the seat in front of me. Im the man at the bottom of the dry well, Im a man stuck in a wall, I’m a woman stuck in a bus, stuck in sand, stuck in time and at my core I feel ecstatic. Electric. Maybe this is what its like to experience deep time. I think its gotten so deep that now as one encounters it even for a second, they can see into the future. On a single day I choke on water, sand and fumes. If there were clouds they would be the sea creatures that once swam in what are now these dusty skies. Where my skull joins the neck, just below the ear, like needle treads through satin remain the sealed dents of gill arches. When the earth pushed away the water and the air was burning our throats, we replaced them with oxygen tanks. At last, Sahara’s nothingness gives way to mountains that pierce the sky as a volcanic eruption of stone. Can the bedouin children that still walk the Sinai tell me what its like to experience the memories of these enormous brutal rocks that were once the hosts of vigorous coral reefs? What is it like to know an abundance of both water and heat? As I wallow around on my seat, I can’t help but be sure I’m on my way to ask them.</p>
<p id='tobecontinued'>TO BE CONTINUED</p>

<h2 id="aft"><a href="#afterword">Afterword</a></h2>
<h5 id='afterwordtext'>I did meet bedouin people as a tourist on the coast of the Red Sea back in August 2022. Their reality was not longer one of a nomadic tribe. The locals told me that they had settled in an around cities like Dahab and Sharm El Sheikh and make ends meet by relying on the year-round tourist presence in the inhabitable parts of the region. Teenagers transported us on their boats between parts of the coast line. Kids drove us in (and on) jeeps from one settlement to the next. Sometimes as they saw their friend moving in the opposite direction on the dirt road they aligned with them and pressed the gas as if to crash head first, smiling devilishly the entire time. Our driver was eight years old. Back then I didn’t think of asking them profound questions about the universe and deep time so I can only speculate on their view on it.</h5>
